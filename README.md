# HW 1: Linked Lists & Recursion

## Overview
This program is the first assignment for the course **Data Structures & Object-Oriented Design** and introduces foundational concepts in C++ programming, string manipulation, and basic data structure implementation.  
It focuses on building and testing custom string-splitting functionality as well as a user-defined linked list structure for storing strings.

The assignment emphasizes **modular program design, pointer-based data structures, and test-driven development**.

## Features
- Custom string splitting functionality
- Implementation of a singly linked list for strings
- Dynamic memory allocation and pointer management
- Unit tests to validate the correctness of implementations
- Grading scripts to automate testing and verification
